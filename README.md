## tclib

Websocket package for tinychat chat rooms.

This is more or less a rewrite of pinylib, but for python 3. This implements some benefits(hopefully) that python 3 has to offer, one of them being asynchronous implementation using asyncio.

I'd like to mention, that a lot of inspiration has been taken from the [discord package](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) by [Rapptz](https://github.com/Rapptz).

## Setup

tclib have been developed using Python 3.7.0 running on windows 7 (64bit). I have not had the opportunity to test it on other platforms, but i suppose it should work, as long as the requirements are met.

### Requirements

See [requirements.txt](https://github.com/nortxort/tclib/blob/master/requirements.txt) for information.

**colorama is an optional requirement. I am not sure, if it should be included or not, at this stage.*

## Usage.

Under construction..
